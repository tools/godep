godep - dependency tool for go

Usage: godep command [arguments]

Commands:

	save	save current list of dependencies to a file
	restore	install exact dependencies previously saved
	diff	show difference between saved and installed deps
	go	run go tool in a temporary sandbox

Writes and reads file Godeps in a package directory.

The go tool is run inside a temporary sandbox containing
the specified versions of all dependencies. When it exits,
any commands that were installed in the sandbox are copied
to the outer $GOPATH/bin.

Godeps format:

- characters from # to end of line are discarded
- blank lines are discarded
- first line names the current package
- second line has output of `go version`
- subsequent lines list needed packages with versions
- packages in the standard library are omitted
- packages inside another listed package are omitted
- each dep line has two tab-separated fields:
  - commit hash
  - package name

Example Godeps:

github.com/kr/hk
go version go1.0.3
28676070ab99	code.google.com/p/go-netrc/netrc
3380ade90f8b	github.com/kr/binarydist
